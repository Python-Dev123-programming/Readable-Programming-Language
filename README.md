## üß† INTRODUCTION

Readable Programming Language, or RPL for short is an interpreted programming language written in Python, with a very readable and easy to understand syntax.

It's good for beginners who start programming for the first time, due to its understandable syntax.

## ‚öôÔ∏è INSTALLATION

-- Step 1: Install Python

To run Readable Programming Language (RPL), you need to install Python.
You can install Python in this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Make sure to add Python to your PATH when installing.

-- Step 2: Clone the Readable Programming Language (RPL) Repository

Type these commands in Command Prompt, on Windows:

git clone https://github.com/Python-Dev123-programming/Readable-Programming-Language.git

cd READABLE-Programming-Language

## ‚ú® FEATURES

Here are the features of Readable Programming Language:

-- Printing and Displaying:

say "Hello, World" - Prints a value. For example: 'say "Hello, World!"'.

show variable (name of the variable) - Prints the value of the variable. For example: 'show variable a' and let's say it prints 'Hey!'.

-- Math and Calculations:

calculate variables: - Calculates the value of the existing variables. You will be asked to write two or more variables and in between them, you need to write an operation. For example: 'a + b'.

add: - Adds two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number.

subtract: - Subtracts two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number.

multiply: - Multiplies two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number.

divide: - Divides two numbers. You will be asked to write the first number and the second number.

power: - You will be asked to write the first number and the second number. Something like this: first number in the power of second number that you have written.

-- Control Flow:

forever: - It creates a forever loop. To exit, you can type 'stop'. For example: in the forever loop, when you write 'say 'Hello!'', it will print 'Hello!' forever, until you close the program.

repeat: - It repeats a string how many times you want. You will be asked what kind of string to repeat and how many times to repeat.

repeat variable: - It repeats an existing variable how many times you want. You will be asked to type the name of the variable and how many times to print that variable.

if: - It creates a if statement. You will be asked to type a variable, an expression, a value and the condition where you can type a line of code. If the condition is True, it will execute the code, but if it's false, it will not execute the code.

-- Functionality:

create a variable: - Creates a new variable. You will be asked about the name of the variable and its value.

create a function: - It creates a new function and you will be asked to type the name of the function. Then you can type some code inside that function forever, until you type 'end the function'. To run the function, you type: 'run (name of the function)'.

run (name of the file): - It runs a supported file that RPL (READABLE Programming Language) can run. It should contain code that can be run by RPL.

-- User interactions:

input 'string'- It will create an input where you can type text. For example: input 'Say something: ', it will display 'Say something: ' and you'll be able to type anything you want.

-- Explanation and Helping:
